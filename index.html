    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>The web, also known as the World Wide Web, is a system of interconnected documents and other resources 
       that are linked by hyperlinks and URLs and can be accessed via the internet. 
       It was created by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and has since become an essential part of 
       modern communication and information sharing.

At its core, the web is a network of servers and clients. Servers store and provide access to web content, 
and clients, such as web browsers, retrieve and display that content. Users can navigate the web by clicking on 
hyperlinks, entering URLs, and using various web-based applications.

The web has revolutionized the way people access and share information, 
making it easier and more convenient to communicate and collaborate across distances. 
Today, the web is used for a wide range of purposes, including communication, entertainment, 
education, commerce, and more. New technologies and standards are being developed constantly 
to enhance its functionality and security, and it continues to shape the future of communication and technology.
